  [425-031123] - Improvements to shader handling. Improvements to scene
  write/load.

  [424-021123] - Improvements to scene stuff, working on updating prototype to
  use new resource/scene stuff. Integrated scene load/save into bundle stuff.
  [423-021123] - Improvements to ui. Text input is now blocked for code that
  is outside of text_edit context during text input.
  [422-021123] - Added mesh hotload.

  [421-011123] - Added scene list for load/save. Added text display offset
  (display text starting at x character index).
  [420-011123] - Improvements to text list.
  [419-011123] - Added duplicate selection and delete selection.
  [418-011123] - More work on img list. Can now change model texture via
  material inspector (basic).

  [417-311023] - Added wip image list (grid of scrollable images).
  [416-311023] - Added mouse over popups for selectables.

  [415-301023] - Improvements to gizmos, now with bidirectional, and root
  handles, shift to scale on any gizmo. Work on scene load/save.

  [414-291023] - Work on material tab for editor inspector.
  [413-291023] - Added ui checkbox, bug fixes.

  [412-281023] - Improvements and bug fixes. Work on inspector transform ui.

  [411-271023] - Further tweaks to ui stuff.
  [410-271023] - Minor tweaks to ui wrapper + commenting quirks. Window size 
  minimums are now enforced.

  [409-261023] - Trying to find source of weird resize flicker bug. Have found
  two temporary fixes, though further enquiry is probably necessary, I think it
  may be a vendor-side bug as pc restart fixes it, gpu driver restart doesn't fix,
  assumption is that Desktop Window Manager from Windows is causing it.
  [408-261023] - Work on aspect ratio and UI, target aspect ratio is now
  predefined, UI is positioned to conform to a rect of the defined
  aspect ratio, regardless of resize; similar to aspect ratio 'black bars'.

  [407-251023] - Work on ui stuff.
  [406-251023] - Some changes to default text origins, and updates to text_list.

  [405-241023] - More work on text stuff.
  [404-241023] - Fixed some bugs with text positioning re: ui wrapper/grid
  system.

  [403-231023] - Various improvements and cleanup for text edit, text, ui, added
  callbacks for text_edit on carriage return, bit of builtin shader work, added
  transform translation and scale to editor inspector, can change its properties
  via text field.

  [402-221023] - Extremely basic scene save/load, just handling transform and
  mesh at the moment. Needs heavy cleanup, spaghetti.
  [401-221023] - Commit before implementing component containers stored as part of
  scenes.
  [400-221023] - Improvements to ui wrapper.
  [399-221023] - Further ui work, improvements to ui wrapper, added drag scroll
  to text lists.

  [398-211023] - More work on ui stuff.
  [397-211023] - Working on moving the wrapper in prototype_0 into core, will
  probably private some of the raw sprite_ui, only access sprite_ui indirectly
  through ui wrapper (the wrapper just constrains positions and sizes to a grid,
  and handles resizing of elements correctly. Also handles child/parent
  transform, but I will likely move that out to more general transform stuff).

  [396-201023] - Gizmo improvements, selection improvements.

  [395-191023] - Added separate gizmo component (no longer a flag of mesh_renderer).
  [394-191023] - Bug fixes and improvements to selection stuff.
  [393-191023] - Added hashset data structure. Multiple selectables can now be
  selected (excluding sprite_ui), shift to add to selection, ctrl to remove from
  selection. Selected selectables are drawn in pulsing wireframe.

  [392-181023] - Selectable ids are now rendered in a separate pass, whilst this
  method is slightly slower (for now), manually handling output of correct
  select_id in each shader was becoming cumbersome. This simplifies a lot of
  stuff regarding framebuffers/deferred routines, etc. There are many optimisations
  I can think of to implement later on, but for now, any
  mesh_renderer/sprite_renderer/sprite_ui that has a selectable, is redrawn in
  the selectable pass.
  [391-181023] - Editor mesh list is populated with bundle_resource names now.
  Some changes to project hashes, including bundle name per entry.

  [390-171023] - Added selectable func pointer 'on_hold'. Selectables with a
  valid 'on_hold' function will run regardless of if the mouse remains on the
  selectable, just needs initial click, expected behaviour. Clicking on a mesh
  list element will create a scene object on the current scene.
  [389-171023] - Adding editor controls. Basic gizmo etc. Not 100% on
  editor/scene/objects design yet.
  [388-171023] - Improvements to text lists. Added available meshes text list
  for editor.

  [387-161023] - Added scrollable text list (working with selectables).
  [386-161023] - Text edit cleanup. (last commit was 151023, not 161023).

  [385-151023] - Changed 'text box' to 'text edit', i.e the text input is
  directly bound to a text component, rather than to a 'text box' wrapper,
  makes things a bit simpler. Added text blink caret.
  [384-151023] - Changed how input is stored, internal arrays are now more
  agnostic, VK keys are now converted to corresponding interal key. Added 
  function to translate last VK code to ascii char for text box input.

  [383-141023] - Added functional text box. Preprocessor cleanup.

  [382-131023] - Added queue data structure. Added selection history. Added
  selectable 'on_deselect()' callback.
  [381-131023] - Added stack datastructure. Added 'core_state', defined core 
  states can be popped/pushed onto stack, the topmost state will be the one that
  is run (i.e splash screen, debug, editor, play, etc). Added user typing input
  into text component, for later use with text boxes etc.

  [380-121023] - Moved splash screen into core. Removed redundant code for old
  reousrce generation stuff. Work on scene / debug hud.

  [379-111023] - Optimisations, cleanup, and improvements for bundle and cache 
  handling, builtin bundles can now be embedded into executable.

  [378-101023] - Optimisations for file read/write.
  [377-101023] - Cleanup for project cache stuff. Hotloading re-enabled for
  textures. Improvements to resources hash handling, cache files will be
  generated as soon as source files are modified/added.

  [376-091023] - Fixed bug with htable iterator not walking buckets that contain
  collided hashes (buckets with valid linked lists) correctly. Fixed bundle
  packing/loading hash generation bug.

  [375-081023] - Bug fixes.

  [374-071023] - Work on loading from cached files.

  [373-061023] - Work on resource hashing.

  [367-021023] - Finishing up ssh server. Working on a scene system.

  [366-011023] - Setting up Linux box for ssh, going to move repo.

  [365-300923] - Cleanup, planning basic basic editor for position static models.

  [357-230923] - More work on resource restructuring, adding some iterator stuff
  to data structures.

  [356-220923] - More work on resource restructuring.

  [355-210923] - More work on resource/file/resource cached hash file etc.
  [354-210923] - More work on resource restructuring.

  [353-200923] - More work on resource restructuring.

  [352-190923] - Continued work on bundle/resource/file handling restructure,
  resouce bundles are now compressed on a per resource basis, not via
  compressing the entire bundle data.

  [351-180923] - Continued work on bundle/resource/file handling restructure.

  [350-170923] - Continued work on bundle/resource/file handling restructure.

  [349-160923] - Continued work on bundle/resource/file handling restructure.

  [348-150923] - Working towards restructuring bundles and resource files so
  that release build will use bundled/compressed data, and debug will use
  individual files to re-enable hotload/live editing.

  Prototyping #0-38.

  [282-140723] - Bug fixes and improvements. Prototyping #0-37.
  
  [281-130723] - Added a basic loading screen with a thread dispatch api which
  force draws specified loading screen sprite_uis whilst waiting for the thread
  to finish, don't really want to split the engine to a render thread/main 
  thread architecture, so this is a minimal alternative to keep things simple for now.

  [280-120723] - Added separate ui render framebuffer. UI should be forward
  rendered by default. Added some additional functions for rendering ui pass
  etc. Added sprite_ui placement origins. Prototyping #0-36.

  manage shader ids along with relevant bundle stuff. Prototyping #0-32.
  
  [275-090723] - Added support for variable cursor sizes. Bug fixes and
  improvements. Mesh instances now properly support atlas frames (previously all

  Prototyping #0-31.

  [273-070723] - Bug fixes to components. Prototyping #0-30.

  [272-060723] - Bug fixes and improvements. Lots of improvements to
  controller/kb input handling. Prototyping #0-29.

  [271-050723] - Bug fixes and improvements. Prototyping #0-28.

  [270-040723] - Improvements to htable, fixed a nasty bug (not sure how it
  didn't produce any noticeable errors). Htable size is now always prime.

  [269-030723] - Various bug fixes and improvements. Finally added looping for
  htable, as well as other htable improvements. htable is ~150-200% faster for
  looping than std::unordered_map, and ~300-400% faster for lookup. Tested with
  100,000,000 entries, K = U32, V = U32.

  [268-020723] - Prototyping #0-27.

  [267-010723] - Prototyping #0-26.

  [254-200623] - Prototyping #0-17.

  [253-190623] - Cleanup.

  [252-180623] - Bug fixes, think there is a bug with untracking, some uid keys
  are colliding for some reason.

  [251-170623] - Added 'staging' pipeline for mesh renderers and sprite
  renderes, so that untracked renderers can be inserted into the render
  pipeline. Not sure if this route is ideal, may be replaced.

  [250-160623] - Cleanup.

  [241-070623] - Resource packing/loading working for audio/meshes/textures now.
   Going to clean up redundancies.

  [240-070623] - Version 0 of resource file packing working for textures. DDS
  files are now packed to minimal representation in bundle (i.e discards unused
  data blocks beyond mips/pixels/header). Fixed bug with mstring/char* hashing.

  [239-060623] - Further work on resources/files etc. Drastic changes, almost
  done.

  [238-050623] - Working on resource file packing/loading, as well as general
  resource database/bundle system.

  [237-040623] - Cleaned up sprite 3d, skews and cardinals are more robust in
  regards to variabililty now. Fixed compiler warnings. Started on adding
  resource packing for single file resource files. Added zlib compression
  (wrapper around minimal third-party). Memo67 LOC is around 18k now (excl. zlib).

  [236-030623] - Fixed bug with instancing. Split first and second pass lighting
  framebuffers (b/c they are not guaranteed to be same dimensions). Added fixed
  8 skew sprite packer. Bug fixes.

  [235-020623] - Testing some graphics styles. Now sending model matrix as
  instance model data. Bug fixes and improvements.

  [228-260523] - Prototyping #0-9.

  [227-250523] - Prototyping #0-8.

  [226-240523] - Added quadtree for colliders (no Y component, for now).
  Dynamic and static colliders are now stored on different tables, done for
  performance, couple of bugs to hammer out. Prototyping #0-7.

  [225-230523] - Added collision layer matrix, separated collision layer and
  collision trigger layer.  Prototyping #0-6.

  [224-220523] - Improvements to text. Prototyping #0-5.

  [223-210523] - Added audio loop stop. Added projectile motion. Replaced _force
  with _velocity, and added function add_force.

  [221-190523] - Fixed issue with first mesh instance not being drawn. Added
  alpha_clip blend type. Other bug fixes and cleanup. Should be back on track
  for prototyping.

  Bug fixes for mstring. Added wireframe cube/sphere debug. Prototyping #0-4.

  [213-110523] - Added function to render transparent sprites after other
  sprites, this is so I can use a different shader and not write to gbuf_wpos so
  shadows aren't stopped at the transparent sprite. Not ideal, replace it later.
  Added better encompass frustum function. Prototyping #0-3.

  [212-100523] - Added caching of meshes for mesh component. Prototyping #0-2.

  [211-090523] - General cleanup. Prototyping #0-1.

  [209-070523] - Added csv loading. Added id to batching. Bug fixing and
   cleanup.

  [208-060523] - Implemented staging/map for id picking correctly, previously
  wasn't accounting for performance hit from synchronising cpu/gpu. Added
  precise sleep function, as well as cleaned up time functions. Added accurate
  fps limiting.

  [207-050523] - Added forward outline shader. Added feature to ensure same
  textures aren't reloaded. Working on selection.

  [206-040523] - Added ui sprite (forward rendered). Added billboard shader. 
  Added property component which is essentially a set a bitflags that can be 
  used for custom properties.

  [205-030523] - More bug fixing for collision/mphyx. Added fixed time step for
   mphyx updates. Collisions/mphyx working as intended for now.

  [204-020523] - Bug fixing for collision/mphyx.

  [203-010523] - Finishing basic collisions/mphyx. Working well, just need to cleanup
  and better check objects moving at higher velocity, e.g some things are getting
  stuck in the ground when landing.

  [202-300423] - Working on physics collisons.

  [201-290423] - Added basic physics. Added bsphere and bbox colliders and
  intersection tests. Added sphere debug.

  [200-280423] - Bug fixes and optimisations. Added helper functions for :
  Converting RGB8, creating texture from colour, getting file extension, screen
  to ray, random V3F. Added load_audio function (.wav only for nonw). Added
  audio_loop function. Prototyping #0-0.

  [199-270423] - Added a few simd maths functions. Fixed bug with sprite
  shadows. Added render flags to mesh renderer and sprite renderer. Commit
  before starting prototype.

  [198-260423] - Added audio attenuation, spatial panning, audio source api.
   Removed runtime .glb, only using internal resources files. Bug fixing, general
   audio api work.

  [197-250423] - Added backend agnostic audio api. Fixed some bugs, and
  optimised sprite3d. Added variadic overload for input key state. Added
  on_lose_focus() callback. Audio api contains: 32 mono, 32 stereo voices, 2x music
  voices (for fades later), volume controls, music stop/start, mute/unmute,
  play_one_shot.

  [196-240423] - Improved sprite3d. Fixed sprite3d not maintaining its forward
   cardinal direction when camera changes forward direction. Added 2x2 matrix.
   Further testing, optimisations.

  [195-230423] - Added wireframe render pass for sprite/mesh. Optional (default)
   line_renderer as wireframe for sprites. Line_renderer now has each segment
   camera-facing. Fixed bug/lag with line_renderer. Removed mi_darray, replaced
   all instances with normal darray; there is a bug with it that caused
   indexing to return duplicate entries when iterating over the structure, know
   where the bug is but can't see obvious fix - temporarily removed.

               - Game work[19].

  [135-280223] - Game work[18].

  [134-270223] - Game work[17].

  [133-260223] - Game work[16].

  [132-250223] - Game work[15].

  [131-240223] - Game work[14].

  [130-230223] - Added pivot to batched sprites.

  [127-200223] - Added pivot to sprite/pivot transformation.
               - Game work[10].

  [126-190223] - Added M4x4F inverse/determinant.
               - Game work[9].

  [125-180223] - Fixed bug with htable.contains_key().
               - Game work[8].

  [124-170223] - Game work[7].

  [123-160223] - Game work[6].
  [122-160223] - Added mouse scroll handling.
               - Models/sprites/batchers are now required to bind their own shader. At render, the currently bound shader is now used,
               not the shader of the primitive. May revert this in future.

  [121-150223] - Game work[5].
  [120-150223] - Added draw layers to renderables to improve draw call order.
               - Static batchers are now sent to normal draw call buffer.

               - Added vignette and blur to deferred quad shader.

  [113-080223] - Added basic 'ui-sprite'.
               - Some further example testing.
  [112-080223] - Separated sprite batcher stuff into its own source.
               - Cleaned up batcher api.
  [111-080223] - Added caching of sprite various densities. 
               - Sprite batchers now have a fixed size, and buffers are allocated with a maximum size on initialisation.
               If a batch call (begin/end) exceeds the limit, the buffered sprites get subdivided into another batch (separate draw call).

  [110-070223] - Added sprite density function, which basically generates the relevant data for a plane mesh with subdivisions.
               - Added render support for various density sprites.
               - Sprite batcher now is agnostic to sprite mesh densities.
               - Static sprite build support various sprite densities.
               - Added camera pos to view matrix constant buffer to allow for 'world bending'. (May move to separate cbuf in future).

  [109-060223] - Added contains_key function to hashtables.
               - Changed depth sorting to use quicksort instead of bubblesort. 
  [108-060223] - Added ping-pong to sprite animator.
               - Deferred render now holds onto the last drawn frame until
               _after_ the update callback function. This is to enable sampling of gbuffer textures if necessary (i.e guid/picking frame).
               - Sprite batcher draw procedure has been changed to enable the deferred frame changes. Batches now cache data, similar to 
               renderable procedure.
  [107-060223] - Added draw debug flag to engine properties.
               - Added mouse clicks to input.

  [106-050223] - DX shaders now add #defines on shader compile (will add ogl later).
               - Lights are now checked if visible before sending to gpu. (precursor to quadtree)
               - Lights now use handle system.
               - Removed references to 'fastlights'
               - Added 'on_ms' function.

  [105-050223] - Added framebuffer render texture formats for 16 and 32 bit.
               - Fixed bug with point light rendering.

  [104-040223] - Minor cleanup.

  [103-030223] - Added general purpose handle manager.
               - Added guid picking data to sprite batching.
  [102-030223] - Added sprite batcher depth sorting.
               - Some changes to benchmarking functions.

  [101-020223] - Added guids to renderables, the guid is used to identify various structs, indexing htables, etc.
               - All sprites are now added to a hash table with their key being their renderable guid.
               - Framebuffers can now support a 'staging' texture slot for dx11 (just one currently). OpenGL version won't need one.
               - Added an additional gbuffer texture that renders the guid of relevant elements (i.e sprites).
               - Added a function to retreive a single pixel from the guid buffer.
               - Added proper primitive_destroy function that does all necessary cleanup.
               - Few fixes here and there. 
               - Note: opengl backend is currently lagging behind dx11 with addition of new features.

  [100-010223] - Fixed bug with frustum culling.
               - Added temporary frustum cull 'overdraw', should move to using bbox bounds for precise culling.
               - Added 'observer/fly cam'.
  [099-010223] - Added plane/ray intersect function.

  [098-310123] - Added one-shot line render.
               - Some minor changes to cameras and how frustums are stored.
               - Re-enabled sprite batcher with new depth sorting stuff, it's in a basic working mode, needs to be bullet-proofed.
               - Restructured the line renderer, no longer has a 'line_renderer' object, just basic functions. The new model is similar to 
               the primitive/collider/MEMO67_handle.

  [097-300123] - Added on_collide functions for colliders.
               - Removed 'rect_2d', now there's just bbox and a separate collider struct.
               - A few minor changes to cameras and sprites.
               - Made a space-invaders-like game to test the engine/api (<300 lines). There are some obvious changes I'd make (and will make,
               most obvious are to do with how things/api interacts with handles and 'book-keeping' stuff).

  [095-290123] - Added functions to add colliders to sprites. Currently collisions are preempted when a sprite is moved,
               they are not all resolved as a single function, that'll come later when needed.
               - Changed layout of lights, point lights now support falloff and radius. (point lights currently not using 
               normals on the point light pass, will need to add another shader to use normals with lights for 3d model stuff).

  [094-280123] - Fixed some issues with depth sorting.
               - Input now uses a bitflag8 type, and some functions have been changed to improve response.
  [093-280123] - Added depth sorting, has temporarily broken batching.
               - Removed 'renderable' inheritance from text, not necessary, would require depth sorting to account for it.

  [092-270123] - Added sprite animator which handles animation functions (i.e play animation), 
               as well as specifying relevant data for the shader to use.
               - Testing things with an example scene.
               - Added build system stuff for examples.

  [091-260123] - Added uv tiling to sprites/sprite detail.
  [090-260123] - Fixed bug with dx11 sampling interpolated tex_ids, resulting in glitches when multiple textures
               are bound to a sprite batcher.
  [089-260123] - Fixed bitwise rgba parse being read backwards.
               - Fixed a few oversights from last lighting changes.
  [088-260123] - Lights now handle types properly.
               - Lights now have a separate constant buffer for point lights and directional lights, 
              this is to reduce loops in shaders, previously they were all packed together and first pass, as well as 
              second pass light shaders had the same constant buffers (i.e light count). The two pass lighting is to 
              support resolution independence for point lights and directional lights. (i.e, can crush resolution of either
              light types to improve performance if desired).
  [087-260123] - Changed GID references to handles, to avoid confusion with typical guid/uuids.

  [086-250123] - Added single header for projects to use with dynamic link build.
  [085-250123] - Textures now use a similar handle system as primitives.
  [084-250123] - Removed some redundancies, cleanup to core render loop.
  [083-250123] - Primitives now use a header/primitive pair, which can be
              looked up with a single handle. This is in keeping with decoupling render
              primitives from last version, whilst keeping code a lot cleaner and further
              decouples primitive data as external structures (renderables) keep no
              primitive data references, only a handle. This was a very large change and may require patches.

  [082-240123] - Decoupled render primitives and gapi buffer data. For better or worse, hopefully handles will be robust.
  [081-240123] - Changes to lighting primitives as well as main 'lights' container.
  [080-240123] - Added basics for a shared library build. Needs some decoupling of internals to keep the import header light.
               - Added basic example using a linked .dll build of the engine.
  [079-240123] - Line renderer now rendered as a forward pass before UI.

  [078-230123] - Text moved to a forward render pass, was causing unnecessary complications with main deferred pass.
  [077-230123] - Added aspect ratio to text.
               - Added rect and wrapping to text.
  [076-230123] - Added text resizing/changing.

  [075-220123] - Text shaders revised.
               - Deferred text v0 complete.

  [074-210123] - Fixed bugs with text uvs.
               - Sourced dx11 depth bug.
               - Fixed bug with passing colour data to buffer for text.
               - Vertex data buffer now void*, not float*.

  [073-200123] - Continued work on dx11 text backend.

  [072-190123] - Added text dx11 backend.

  [071-180123] - Commenting.

  [070-170123] - Minor cleanups.

  [069-160123] - Lighting cleanups.

  [068-150123] - Primitive union renaming.

  [067-140123] - Cleanups. 

  [066-130123] - Minor cleanup. 

  [065-120123] - Added primitive remove function, untested.

  [064-110123] - Added primitive handle.

  [063-100123] - Few cleanups.

  [062-090123] - Minor cleanups.

  [061-080123] - Fixed bug with bitmap text uvs.

  [060-070123] - Added bitmap text rendering, still some bugs to fix.

  [059-060123] - Temporary fix for depth buffer resolution mismatch for light pass.
  [058-060123] - Fixed bug with sprite batcher and normal data.

  [057-050123] - Cleaned up primitive_render code. Added some render stat stuff. Fixed HLSL deferred shaders.

  [056-040123] - Added depth buffer texture to opengl version of gbuffer pass, forgot about it.
  [055-040123] - Added functions to bind specific framebuffer slots.
               - Added functions to clear all render targets/attachments, necessary to individually clear for opengl
              as when attachments are of different size. (opengl renders the smallest of the attachments, so large ones are only partially
              cleared/drawn to when cleared together). Dx11 doesn't support rendertargets of different size, but they are cleared
              individually with ClearRenderTargetView() anyway." 

  [054-040123] - Added render view resize function.
               - Changed window creation to use AdjustWindowRect() (win32), necessary to get consistent resize between dx11 and opengl, 
               I think opengl's ndc are set with the initial gl context, so glViewport() sets the correct w/h without needing to adjust 
               to account for border/style sizes, whereas dx11 requires adjustment. Creating the window with AdjustWindowRect() normalises
               behaviour between dx11 and opengl.
  
  [053-030123] - Dx11 support for framebuffer stuff is in a working state.
               - Various API changes, relating to the new Dx11 changes.

  [052-020123] - Working on adding Dx11 support for the new framebuffer stuff.
               - Did a small 2.5D test (DST style). Cool.

  [051-010123] - Changelog updates.
  [050-010123] - Initial commits.

[changelog preface]

GitHub initial commit started at svn version [050], 010123.

[050-010123] contains the following features:

  -Framebuffer stuff.

  -Collisions (very basic, preemptive function).

  -Input handling (keyboard & mouse).

  -Timing (basic).

  -Line renderer.
    -Supports sdf-mode (as well as mesh mode) which renders lines as an sdf
      surface. Much slower, but cool.

  -SDF surface.
    -SDFs rendered in-shader with raymarching.
  
  -Camera (basic)
    -Orthographic and perspective.

  -Model, View, Projection matrices.

  -Matrices and Vectors (templated).
    -M4x4 matrices support SIMD multiplication.

  -Buffer resolution independence:
    -Lighting passes as well as final frame resolution can be set.

  -Lighting, directional and point.
    -Currently lights are deferred only. 
    -Rendered in two passes, first directional lights, then point lights.

  -Deferred rendering.
    -When deferred rendering is enabled, Memo67's internal loop binds a deferred
    framebuffer, subsequent draw calls are then rendered to the gbuffer/s.
    Lighting is then rendered with the gbuffer/s as input (as well as lighting
    constant buffers) before finally rendering the frame to a quad.

  -Shader system:
    -Single .sha shader files are written containing both .hlsl and .glsl code, 
      the file separates the two shader languages, as well as vertex and pixel
      shaders with #defines.
    -Constant buffers.
    -Each 'default' (i.e part of Memo67, not a custom added shader) shader corresponds to a enum value.
    -'Default' shaders include gbuffer variants, phong model, gouraud model, sprite, generic model, line, etc.

  -Sprite rendering with animation.

  -Sprite batcher.

  -OBJ model loader. (basic)

  -BMP image loader.

  -Dx11 and OpenGL3.3 backends. Current version [050] has not yet implemented
    Dx11 for the new framebuffer deferred stuff.

  -Custom data structures:
    -Dynamic array
    -Hashtable, current hash function starts with a constant and then uses a
      prime number table along with various circular shifts, additions,
      multiplications etc, works well enough for now.
    -Linked list (single)

Official start date 021122. - Project started 260922 with svn commit [001],
however, real work started on 021122 with svn commit [021].
